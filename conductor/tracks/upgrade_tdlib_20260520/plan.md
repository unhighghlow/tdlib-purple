# Implementation Plan - Upgrade to tdlib 1.8.64

This plan outlines the steps to upgrade TDLib to version 1.8.64 and verify the integration.

## Phase 1: Environment & Dependency Update
- [x] Task: Update TDLib dependency to 1.8.64
    - [x] Update Git submodule or source directory for TDLib
    - [x] Update `CMakeLists.txt` version requirement to 1.8.64
- [x] Task: Build TDLib 1.8.64
    - [x] Execute TDLib build process as described in README
    - [x] Ensure TDLib headers and libraries are available for the plugin build
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Environment & Dependency Update' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Compilation & Refactoring
- [x] Task: Adapt codebase to TDLib 1.8.64 changes
    - [x] Identify and fix any compilation errors due to breaking changes in TDLib API
    - [x] Refactor code to use new TDLib patterns if recommended
- [x] Task: Compile tdlib-purple with new TDLib
    - [x] Run CMake configuration
    - [x] Execute build and ensure `telegram-tdlib` SHARED library is generated (Tests still failing)
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Compilation & Refactoring' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Verification & Testing
- [ ] Task: Update and Run Automated Tests
    - [ ] Write Tests: Add new test cases if new TDLib features are utilized or if API changes require new verification logic
    - [ ] Run Tests: Execute `make run-tests` and ensure all tests pass
- [ ] Task: Manual Functional Verification
    - [ ] Verify basic messaging (send/receive)
    - [ ] Verify media handling (photos/stickers)
    - [ ] Verify Secret Chat functionality
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3: Verification & Testing' (Protocol in workflow.md)
